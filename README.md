# Python-Contact-Management-Software

ContactEase Solutions aims to simplify the management of phone contacts for its users by developing an intuitive and interactive software that optimizes the organization and access to personal information.

Users often find it difficult to manage and organize their phone contacts efficiently. Few simple and intuitive solutions exist that allow users to add, modify, delete, view, and search for contacts in a single location, directly from the terminal.

ContactEase Solutions will provide an interactive console application that, thanks to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, will allow for simple and structured contact management. Users will be able to easily save and load contacts in a file format (e.g., JSON), ensuring efficient and secure data management.
